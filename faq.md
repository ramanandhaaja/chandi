The Teman Bus (Trans Metro Dewata) service runs from the airport. However, it's
not a direct route. You would need to take a bus to a terminal in Central Kuta and
then transfer to another bus line to reach Sanur. The journey, including the transfer,
can take around 1 hour and 40 minutes, and it's generally not recommended for
travelers with a lot of luggage.
For a more convenient option, you can use ride-sharing apps like Grab or Gojek,
which are popular in Bali, or hire a private taxi directly from the airport.
What is the best way to navigate in Bali?
-
Navigating Bali's diverse landscape oﬀers several options, with the choice often
depending on your destination and preferences.

oﬀer both cars and motorcycles, providing flexibility for diﬀerent traﬃc
conditions and travel needs. Be aware that ride-hailing services may be
restricted in some areas due to local taxi regulations.
Rental Vehicles: For those seeking greater freedom to explore at their own
pace, renting a scooter or car is a popular option. Scooter rentals are ideal
for navigating congested areas and short-to-medium distances, while a car is
a more practical choice for longer trips, such as venturing to the more
remote northern regions of the island.
Public Transportation: It's important to note that Bali has a very limited
public transportation network. There are no local trains. There's a bus
system called Trans Metro Dewata, but it's not very eﬃcient since the routes
are limited, schedules can be unreliable, and it's mostly used by locals.
